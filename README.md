[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/sack-vfs/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/sack-vfs/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/sack-vfs/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/d3x0r/sack.vfs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/d3x0r/sack.vfs)

- WebSocket/HTTP/HTTPS network library.  UDP sockets (`http`,`UDP` replacment).
- JSON/[JSON6](https://github.com/d3x0r/JSON6) (stream)parser,
- [JSOX](https://github.com/d3x0r/JSOX) (streaming) parser,
- Node addon for a custom virtual and physical file system interface (fs replacement).
- USB keyboard raw input (windows)
- Graph Database and Object Storage.
- Primitive Natural Language tokenizer, and attributed text type.
- OpenSSL/LibreSSL Certificate Generation (https, wss).
- Salty Random Generator - procedural random content generator.
- Simple Play a Sound. (windows, but can port to openAl and cross platform)
- Process control; launch and control tasks launched.
- Sqlite/ODBC database driver; minimal SQL interface, `open` and `do`.
- Option/Configuration Database support using sqlite/odbc interface; stores in a heirarchy of options per program and global.
- Monitor filesystem for changes to files (caching server update).
- Configuration file parser/log analyzer based on word token matches.
- opt-out per-worker access to tasks and filesystem access.


## Requirements

### All Systems
  * Node, NPM.
  * `npm install -g node-gyp`
  * a working build environment
     * (win32) `npm install -g windows-build-tools` - if these are not initially installed, it will require a system restart, without any visible notice; but the install will not complete until restarted.
     * ninja, gcc 
  * (opt) `npm install -g cmake-js` and `cmake`.


### ODBC and uuid support. (can be disabled)

ODBC connectivity is provided as an alternative to the sqlite interface, providing connectivity
with all existing databases.  It is not required; Sqlite itself is not 'required' but special steps
have to be taken to disable it.  When enabled, the [SACK](https://github.com/d3x0r/sack) library uses
it to configure some runtime options.  Options may be controlled by an 'interface.conf' configuration file.

#### Various Linux

 *  yum install gcc-c++ libuuid-devel unixodbc-devel
    * (uuid/uuid.h sql.h)
 *  apt-get install uuid-dev unixodbc-dev 
    * (uuid/uuid.h sql.h)
 *  pacman -S unixodbc util-linux
    * (sql.h uuid/uuid.h(probably already available, fs2util) )
 *  (?)emerge unixodbc

#### Mac

  *  (ODBC might be optioned out; just uses sqlite typically)
  *  brew (brew install unixODBC)

#### Windows

  * None additional


# Usage

``` js
const sack = require( 'sack.vfs' );

```

``` mjs
import {SACK} from "sack.vfs";


```

## Overview of SACK Namespace Object


```
{
    ComPort(comport) - access to com ports.
     - A jsox (JavaScript Object eXchange) parser. (JSON5/6 input compatible)
        parse(string) - result with a V8 object created from the json string.  
        begin( cb ) - begin parsing JSOX stream; callback is called as each value is completed.
        stringifier() - create a reusable stringifier which can be used for custom types
        stringify(object,replacer,pretty) - stringify an object; same API as JSON.
    JSOX - A jsox parser. (JSON5 input compatible)
        parse(string) - result with a V8 object created from the json string.  
        begin( cb ) - begin parsing JSOX stream; callback is called as each value is completed.
        stringify(obj [,stringifer [,formatter])
    JSON6 - A json6 parser. (JSON5 input compatible)
        parse(string [,reviver]) - result with a V8 object created from the json string.  
        begin( cb ) - begin parsing JSON6 stream; callback is called as each value is completed.
        stringify(obj [,stringifer [,formatter])
    JSON - A json parser.
        parse(string) - result with a V8 object created from the json string.  
        begin( cb ) - begin parsing JSON stream; callback is called as each value is completed.
    Sqlite(dbName) - an interface to sqlite which can open databases in the volume.
            parameters - ( databaseName )
                databaseName maybe a simple ODBC name; if the name ends with .db, it is assumed to be 
                a sqlite database.  If ODBC is not available, it may be assumed that the name will 
                just be a sqlite database name. Extra syntax - if the name starts with a $, then the 
                next word after $ and before the next @ or $ is used to select a sqlite vfs name.
                ( https://sqlite.org/vfs.html )  
                if the name is 'sack' then after @ and before the next $ is specified a mounted filesystem name.
        Sqlite has methods available on it to access native program options.
        Sqlite.op( opName, defaultValue ) - read/write default option database option.
        Sqlite.so( opName, newValue ) - write new value to default option database.
    ObjectStorage( fileName [, version] ) - open a JS object storage database. 
    Volume([mountName,]fileName[,version]) - a virtual disk partition that holds files.
          mountName - the mount name used to mount to volume as a filesystem; it may be referenced 
                later in the string passed to Sqlite.  It may be `null` if it is anonymous mount.
          if no parameters are passed, a Volume object representing the native filesystem is returned.
    Volume.mkdir(pathname) - utility function to make directories which might not exist before volume does; 
            (Volume() auto creates directories now if specified path to filename does not exist)
            parameters - (pathname)
                path to create- will created missing parent path parts too.
    Volume.readAsString( filename ) - memory map map a file from native filesystem as a utf8 string.
    Volume.mapFile( filename, loaded_callback ) - memory map map a file from native filesystem as an arrayBuffer.
            if loaded callback is specified, a thread is created that touches every page in the file, when it's done
            the callback is called with no parameters.
    File - some native filsystem utility methods(?)
    FileMonitor - receive event notifications when files change
    SaltyRNG(feed salt callback) - creates a random number generator

        signcert( {options} ) - uses a certificate to sign a certificate request
        validate( {options} ) - validate a certificate against a certificate chain.
        expiration( certificate ) - gets the expiration of a certificate as a Date().

            post( accepted_socket, unique_destination_string ) - posts a socket to another thread
            accept( unique_destination_string, ( newSocket )=>{} ) - receives posted accepted sockets
    HTTP - HTTP Request Method
        get( {options} ) - synchronous http request

    Id() - generate a short unique ID (12 bytes, 16chars).
    loadComplete() - Indicate to SACK system that this is completed loading (task summoner support;linux;deprecated)

    System - Namespace for SACK system interface routines (The above methods should be moved into this namespace)
	createMemory(name,byte size) - creates a named memory region; memory regions by name are shared on the system.
	openMemory(name) - opens an existing names region; returns an ArrayBuffer which can be mapped to a typed array by application.

## Node JS Loader Support

Node loader hooks for [`.json6`](https://github.com/d3x0r/json6) and [`.jsox`](https://github.com/d3x0r/JSOX) file types.
This loader does an import of `sack.vfs` and sets `globalThis.SACK` with the result; and then also assigns 
`globalThis.JSOX` and `globalThis.JSON6`.  

The loader hooks are loaded with the option

```
    --experimental-loader=node_modules/sack.vfs/import.mjs
```

Previously support for `.json6` and `.jsox` were only provided for `require()`.

Loading either JS version of [JSON6](https://github.com/d3x0r/json6) or [JSOX](https://github.com/d3x0r/jsox) should be done after this, allowing them to replace the globalThis versions.
The sack.vfs version is still available via `SACK.JSOX` or `SACK.JSON6`.  

Performance-wise the JS versions have advantages if the information to parse is sourced in JS, while the SACK versions
can operate directly on the array buffers loaded from SACK databases, Volumes and files.  Which limits the copy one side; otherwise
there's a conversion to string from binary and a copy of that string from JS to C potentially.
